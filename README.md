    <p>Data understanding and exploratory analysis</p>
    <p>Train-test split with stratified k-fold cross-validation</p>
    <p>Model building and hyperparameter tuning</p>
    <p>Model evaluation using imbalanced classification metrics.</p>
    <p>Business Impact: Perform a cost-benefit analysis to compare costs before and after model deployment.</p>
    <p>Fraud Detection Impact: The model reduces fraud-related losses by flagging suspicious transactions and adding a second layer of authentication.</p>
